## Evidence Standards

For each category score, include at least one evidence item:
- Direct quote and source (`resume`, `interview transcript`, `notes`)
- Timestamp when available
- Brief interpretation (1 line max)

If evidence is weak/missing, reduce score and confidence.

## Recommendation Logic (Advisory)

- **Admit:** Most categories >=7, no major integrity concerns.
- **Borderline:** Mixed profile (many 5-7), clear upside + manageable risks.
- **Reject:** Multiple categories <=4 and/or serious integrity concern.
- **Insufficient Data:** Evidence too limited or unreliable to make fair judgment.

## Bias and Fairness Guardrails

Do not evaluate or infer based on protected characteristics.
Focus on demonstrated competencies and context-aware opportunity.
When uncertain, state uncertainty explicitly instead of filling gaps with assumptions.
